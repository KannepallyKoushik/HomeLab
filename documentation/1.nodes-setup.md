# Homelab Nodes Setup

## Overview

This HomeLab serves as a comprehensive learning and development environment focused on exploring emerging technologies, particularly Kubernetes and container orchestration in an on-premises setting. The infrastructure is designed to provide hands-on experience with modern DevOps practices, cloud-native technologies, and open-source solutions.

### Primary Objectives

**ðŸŽ¯ Technology Exploration & Learning**
- Gain practical experience with Kubernetes cluster management and orchestration
- Explore container technologies, service mesh, and microservices architecture
- Learn infrastructure-as-code principles and GitOps methodologies
- Experiment with monitoring, logging, and observability tools

**ðŸš€ Personal Project Deployment**
- Deploy personal projects using end-to-end automated CI/CD pipelines
- Implement GitOps workflows for application lifecycle management
- Practice blue-green deployments, canary releases, and rollback strategies
- Build scalable, resilient applications using cloud-native patterns

**ðŸ”§ Open Source Technology Stack**
- Leverage open-source alternatives to enterprise solutions
- Build cost-effective infrastructure using community-driven tools
- Contribute back to the open-source ecosystem through learning and experimentation
- Evaluate and compare different technology solutions for real-world scenarios

### Infrastructure Philosophy

**Hybrid Architecture**: Combining virtual machines (control plane) with physical hardware (worker nodes) to simulate realistic enterprise environments while maintaining cost efficiency.

**Production-Like Environment**: Implementing proper DNS resolution, ingress controllers, persistent storage, and networking to mirror production deployments.

**Automation-First Approach**: Everything is documented, version-controlled, and automated where possible to ensure reproducibility and maintainability.

**Security & Best Practices**: Following industry standards for security, monitoring, and operational excellence from the ground up.

### Learning Outcomes

This HomeLab environment provides practical experience with:
- **Container Orchestration**: K3s/Kubernetes cluster management
- **Infrastructure Management**: Physical and virtual server administration
- **Network Engineering**: DNS, ingress, load balancing, and service discovery
- **DevOps Practices**: CI/CD pipelines, GitOps, and automated deployments
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Metrics, logging, and alerting systems
- **Security**: Network policies, RBAC, secrets management, and TLS/SSL

The ultimate goal is to create a production-ready environment that serves as both a learning platform and a deployment target for personal projects, all while maintaining professional standards and best practices.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Hardware Setup

#### Control Plane (k8s-control-plane)
- **Platform**: Virtual Machine on Mac using VMware Fusion
- **Host Machine**: MacBook (main work machine)
- **VM Configuration**: 3 cores, 4GB RAM, 30GB storage
- **Network**: Bridged networking for local network access

#### Worker Nodes (k-worker1-mini & k-worker2-large)
- **Platform**: Dedicated physical computers
- **Installation**: Ubuntu Server OS installed directly on hardware
- **Network**: Connected to local network via Ethernet

### 2. OS Installation

#### Control Plane - Ubuntu VM Setup (VMware Fusion)
1. **Create New VM in VMware Fusion**
   - Open VMware Fusion
   - Select "Create a custom virtual machine"
   - Choose "Linux" â†’ "Ubuntu 64-bit"
   
2. **VM Configuration**
   - Allocate 4GB RAM
   - Create 30GB virtual disk
   - Set 3 CPU cores
   - Configure bridged networking
   
3. **Ubuntu Server Installation**
   - Download Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS ISO
   - Mount ISO to VM and boot
   - Follow standard Ubuntu Server installation
   - Configure static IP: 192.168.0.110
   - Enable SSH access

#### Worker Nodes - Ubuntu Server Installation (Physical Hardware)
1. **Create Bootable USB Drive**
   - Download Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS ISO
